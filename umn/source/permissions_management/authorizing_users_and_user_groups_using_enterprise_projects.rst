Authorizing Users and User Groups Using Enterprise Projects
===========================================================

Enterprise Project Management Service (EPS) is used to control user access to APM resources.

After creating IAM user groups for employees, you can create enterprise projects on the Enterprise Management console and grant permissions to the user groups in the enterprise projects to implement personnel authorization and permission control.

You can create enterprise projects. Then you can manage resources across different regions by enterprise project, grant different permissions to user groups, and add them to enterprise projects.
