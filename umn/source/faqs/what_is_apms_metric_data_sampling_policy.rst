What Is APM's Metric Data Sampling Policy?
==========================================

After you enable data collection, APM collects application performance metrics and tracing data. Your personal privacy data will not be collected. For details, see section "Data Collection" in *APM Service Overview*.

APM can collect data about applications, infrastructure, and user experience from Agents non-intrusively.

Metric data is collected regularly. The default collection period is 1 minute.
